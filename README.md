# JS/CC-NODE

This project is a port of [JS/CC](http://jscc.jmksf.com) to nodejs (version >= 0.4.7).

## INTRODUCTION

JS/CC is the first available parser development system for [JavaScript and ECMAScript-derivates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript). It has been developed, both, with the intention of building a productive compiler development system and  creating an easy-to-use an academic environment for people interested in how parse table generation is done generaly in bottom-up parsing.

The platform-independent software unions both: A regular expression-based [lexical analyzer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexer) generator matching individual tokens from the input character stream and a [LALR(1)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR_parser) parser generator, computing the parse tables for a given context-free grammar specification and building a stand-alone, working parser. The [context-free grammar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar) fed to JS/CC is defined in a [Backus-Naur-Form-based](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus_Naur_Form) meta language, and allows the insertion of individual semantic code to be evaluated on a rule's reduction.

JS/CC itself has been entirely written in JavaScript. These versions are capable of assembling a complete compiler from a JS/CC parser specification, which is then stored to a .js JavaScript source file.

To use JS/CC and for understanding its internals and behaviors, some knowledge of context-free grammars, bottom-up parsing techniques and compiler construction theory, in general, is assumed.
